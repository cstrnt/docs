# Testing a Spec

## The Fig Linter

The [withfig/autocomplete](https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete) repo contains uses Typescript and its compiler to validate your specs automatically. It returns syntax and type errors from your autocomplete spec.

To typecheck all specs in the /specs folder, simply run
`npm test`.

Note that you'll need to run `npm install` to grab the right dependencies.

## What's the best way to test my spec?

1. Make sure Fig is on and autocomplete is working
2. Put your spec in the `~/.fig/autocomplete` directory (or symlink it there from wherever you are building it)
3. Test your spec automatically using the Fig linter
4. Test your spec manually in the terminal:
   - Go to a new line in your terminal
   - Type `cd`
   - Backspace repeatedly until the line is empty
   - Type the command for the completion spec as you would normally

## That's weird - Why do I have to type in `cd` to test? 

Fig caches completion specs on each load.  Typing in `cd` invalidates the cache by loading the `cd` completion spec.

Let's say you are building a completion spec for your CLI tool, `foobar`. When you type `foobar` into your Terminal, Fig loads the `foobar`completion spec. This spec will remain loaded until another one replaces it. No matter what changes you make to the `foobar` spec, these will not be displayed until you load another spec, then load up `foobar` again.

## Where should I save my completion spec?

Fig reads completion specs from the following folder: `~/.fig/autocomplete`

You can edit your spec there. Or you can edit it from anywhere and symlink it to that repo

```bash
ln -s /path/to/my/spec ~/.fig/autocomplete/
```


## How do I view the logs?

Right click the popup window and click **Inspect Element.** It will open up Safari's web dev console

## My spec isn't showing up in autocomplete

- Is autocomplete working? Try going to a new line in the terminal and typing `git` or `cd` plus a space. 
   - If Fig pops up, autocomplete is working. Chances are it is a problem with your script. Make sure you have correct syntax. View the logs (above) for any errors. 
   - If Fig doesn't pop up, autocomplete has crashed ðŸ˜¬. Click to the Fig Icon (â—§) in the mac status bar and toggle autocomplete on and off

- If Fig still doesn't work, restart Fig ( â—§ -> Restart Fig)

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute, please fork our [withfig/autocomplete](https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete) github repo and submit a PR. 



Your spec will have to pass a linting test in GitHub actions and a quick security review by the Fig team before we merge it.
